## About the Project

The Solid Projection Simulator project aims to replicate the manual method of projecting solids onto a 2D plane, but with the efficiency and flexibility offered by programming. It employs mathematical calculations and the Python Turtle library to simulate the projection process for hexagonal pyramids and hexagonal prisms.

## Features

- Simulate the projection of hexagonal pyramids and hexagonal prisms.
- User-friendly interface for inputting base length, axis length, and angle of inclination.
- Mathematical calculations determine drawing positions for accurate projections.
- Swift visualization using Python Turtle library accelerates testing and experimentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Solid Projection Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.exe` executable to launch the simulator.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input parameters for different projections.
4. Enjoy the visualizations created by the Python Turtle graphics library.

## Usage

1. Launch the program using `main.exe`.
2. Select the type of solid you want to project (hexagonal pyramid or hexagonal prism).
3. Enter the required parameters: base length, axis length, and angle of inclination.
4. The simulation will generate a projection based on your inputs.

## Future Enhancements

This project has a lot of potential for growth. Some future enhancements might include:

- Adding more solid shapes to the simulation.
- Allowing users to customize colors and drawing styles.
- Improving the user interface for a smoother experience.
- Creating a web-based version to reach a broader audience.
